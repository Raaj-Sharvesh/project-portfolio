<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Raaj Sharvesh, and I am currently a student of Class 12 E at CS Academy, Coimbatore. 
  I’m pursuing the Commerce stream with Applied Mathematics, which allows me to explore the practical and analytical sides of business and finance.
   I enjoy learning new concepts that challenge my thinking and help me grow both academically and personally.</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I have a strong passion for cricket. Playing cricket has taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to stay focused under pressure.
 Whether it's a casual match with friends or a more competitive game, 
 the sport keeps me active and motivated, while also offering a great way to unwind and have fun.</p>

<p>In addition to academics and sports, I am also a web developer. 
I love building websites and exploring how technology can solve real-world problems. 
Coding allows me to be creative and logical at the same time. 
I’m constantly learning new tools and techniques in web development,
and I enjoy experimenting with designs and features that improve user experience.</p>
